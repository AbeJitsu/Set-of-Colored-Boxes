In this lab, you'll practice using CSS colors by designing boxes.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should set the background color for body to #f4f4f4.
You should have a div with a class of color-grid to hold all your color elements.
You should have five div elements within the .color-grid element.
The five div elements should each have a class of color-box and color#, where # is the number of the order of that div. For example: color1 for the first div, color2 for the second, and so on.
The .color-box class should have a set width and height so your div elements are visible on the page.
The .color1 element should have a background-color that uses hexadecimal color value.
The .color2 element should have a background-color that uses an RGB color value.
The .color3 element should have a background-color that uses a predefined (word) color value.
The .color4 element should have a background-color that uses a HSL color value.
The .color5 element should have a background-color set.
